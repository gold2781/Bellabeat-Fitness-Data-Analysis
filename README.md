### Project Overview

In this project, I analyze Fitbit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the Fitbit app and discover trends for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### Data Source

Fitness Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "dailyActivity_merged.csv" file, from Kaggle, containing detailed information about the Fitbit Fitness Tracker.


### Tools

     - Microsoft Excel: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization [Download_here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial cleaning face I performed the following
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Checking for null and missing values
3. Changing date format
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the bellabeet fitness data to answer key questions such as;
- What are majority of the users of FitBit tracker using it for?
- What days do users of the app prefer to track their activities

### Data Analysis

I used pivot tables and charts

[Table](statistical findi![statistical findings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f032bd77-7db5-4e33-86ac-e52f07ff7b20)

From the table people spent more time, more steps and burnt more calories on Tuesdays.

In this histogram, we are looking at the frequency of Fitbit app usage in terms of days of the week. The frequency dropped on Monday and continued on Wednesday through to Thursday

[Graph](scatter diagram.P![scatter diagram plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40c63253-54ae-43e8-b618-7dfd0265f68d)

We observed that intensity of calories burned increases when users are at the range of > 0 t0 15,000 steps with calories burn rate cooling down from 15,000 steps onwards

From the chart; Sedentary minutes takes the biggest slice at 83.28%
Also, the app is rarely being used to track fitness as per the minor percentage of fairly active  activity (1.09%) and  very active activity (1.7%). This is highly discouraging as FitBit app was developed to encourage fitness

### Results and Findings

- Majority of users (83.28%) are using the Fitbit app to track sedentary activities and not using it for tracking their health habits.
- Users prefer to track their activities during the end of the week day as compared to the beginning of the week - perhaps they're less busy during Thursdays and Friday and very busy as compared to Mondays and Tuesdays.


### Recommendations

- Introduce an educational healthy style campaign which will pair with a point-reward incentive system, where users completing the whole week's exercise will receive Bellabeat points on products/memberships to encourage them use the app through the whole week and not only during the end of the weekday.
- On Mondays and Tuesdays, Bellabeat can also prompt notifications to encourage users to exercise.
