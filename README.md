### Project Overview

In this project, I analyze FitBit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

### Data Source

Fitness Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "dailyActivity_merged.csv" file, from kaggle, containing detailed information about the FitBit Fitness Tracker.


### Tools

   - Microsoft Excel : Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization [Download_here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial cleaning face I performed the following
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Checking for null and missing values
3. Changing date format
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the bellabeet fitness data to answer key questions such as;
- What are majority of the users of FitBit tracker using it for?
- What days do users of the app prefer to track their activities

### Data Analysis

I used pivot tables and charts

### Results and Findings

- Majority of users (83.28%) are using the FitBit app to track sedentary acativities and not using it for tracking their health habits.
- Users prefer to track their activities during the end of the week day as compared to the beginning of the week- perhaps they're less busy during Thursdays and Friday and very busy as compared to Mondays and Tuesdays.

### Recommendations

- Educational healthy style campaign can pair with a point-reward incentive system. Users completing the whole week's exercise will receive Bellabeat points on products/memberships.
- On Mondays and Tuesdays, Bellabeat can also prompt notifications to encourage users to exercise.
- Educational healthy style campaign encourages users to have short active exercises getting to the end of the weekday, and longer on Mondays and Tuesdays.
